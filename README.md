## ðŸ’­ Reflections ðŸ’­
***
I enjoyed this project a lot! It was fun switching between FrontEnd and BackEnd. Eventually I came up with a system of work that streamlined everything. So overall this project was smooth and simple.

<br>

Issues that came up:
- I did struggle just a bit with getting my dev environment setup like I wanted. MongoDB Compass was struggling a bit to relay the correct error messages I needed to solve my issues. But thankfully Google is a dear friend ðŸ˜» 


If I were to continue on this project / start over I would:
- Add sorting and pagination options
