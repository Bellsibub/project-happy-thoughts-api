## ðŸ’­ Reflections ðŸ’­
***
I enjoyed this project a lot! It was fun switching between FrontEnd and BackEnd. Eventually I came up with a system of work that streamlined everything. I decided to have two VSCode sessions open (one for each environment) and then I first made changes to the API, then switched to the FrontEnd to implement some features that dispaly the new API changes. So overall this project was smooth and simple.

<br>

Issues that came up:
- I did struggle just a bit with getting my dev environment setup like I wanted. MongoDB Compass was struggling a bit to relay the correct error messages I needed to solve my issues. But thankfully Google is a dear friend ðŸ˜». I found out that since I setup using dotenv and made a dynamic switch of MONGO_URL depending on NODE_ENV, I had forgotten to setup switching NODE_ENV on npm scripts.
  
  So therefore I fixed it by chaning the npm scripts:
  ```json
  "dev": "set NODE_ENV=development&&nodemon server.js --exec babel-node"
  ```
  
  So whenever running the dev script I will always use the development environment. I honestly thought that running the dev script would automatically set it to `NODE_ENV=development`, but apperently not... ðŸ¤”

If I were to continue on this project / start over I would:
- Add sorting and pagination options
